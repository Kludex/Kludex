# Hi there! üëã

My name is **Marcelo**, but you can call me "Marceloooooooo" in French, "Marce" in Spanish, and "MarTCHHHelo" in Italiano.<br/>
But I'm originally from <b style="color:green">Brazil</b>! üòé‚úåÔ∏è

I'm a maintainer of **[Uvicorn]** and **[Starlette]**, and I'm also considered a **[FastAPI Expert]**.
