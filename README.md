# Hi there! 👋

My name is **Marcelo**, and I'm from 🇧🇷 (and half 🇮🇹)! 😎

I'm a maintainer of **[Uvicorn]** and **[Starlette]**, and I'm also considered a **[FastAPI Expert]**. 🤓

I'm currently working at **[Pydantic]**. 🚀

I also have a [YouTube channel], where I talk about Python, FastAPI, and other stuff. 🎥

Besides that, I also speak at [Python conferences]! 🎤

### I want to contribute!

Do you want to start on open source but you don't know where to start?

That's great! I'm always looking for help on my projects. 🤩

This section is an updated list of issues that _you_ can help. 🤓
