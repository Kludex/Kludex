# Hi there! 👋

My name is **Marcelo**, and I'm from 🇧🇷 (and half 🇮🇹)! 😎

I'm a maintainer of **[Uvicorn]** and **[Starlette]**, I'm considered a **[FastAPI Expert]**. 🤓

I'm currently working at **[Pydantic]**. 🚀

## YouTuber

I also have started [my YouTube channel] where I talk about Python, FastAPI, and other stuff. 🎥
