# Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my profile! :smile:

My name is Marcelo, but you can call me "Marceloooooooo" in French, "Marce" in Spanish, and "MarTCHHHelo" in Italiano.<br/>
But I'm originally from Brazil! 😎✌️

I'm currently working at [Deliverect](https://deliverect.com) as Software Engineer. <br/>
I'm also a member of [encode](https://www.encode.io/), which I help mainly maintaining [uvicorn](https://github.com/encode/uvicorn) and [starlette](https://github.com/encode/starlette).
