# Hi there! 👋

My name is **Marcelo**, and I'm from 🇧🇷 (half 🇺🇾, half 🇮🇹)! 😎

I'm a maintainer of **[Uvicorn]** and **[Starlette]**, and I'm also considered a **[FastAPI Expert]**. 🤓

I'm currently working at **[Pydantic]**. 🚀

I also have a [YouTube channel], where I talk about Python, FastAPI, and other stuff. 🎥

Besides that, I also speak at [Python conferences]! 🎤
