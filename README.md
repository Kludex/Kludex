# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Marcelo**, and I'm from ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· (and half ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹)! ðŸ˜Ž

I'm a maintainer of **[Uvicorn]** and **[Starlette]**, and I'm also considered a **[FastAPI Expert]**. ðŸ¤“

I'm currently working at **[Pydantic]**. ðŸš€

I also have a [YouTube channel], where I talk about Python, FastAPI, and other stuff. ðŸŽ¥

Besides that, I also speak at [Python conferences]! ðŸŽ¤

## Wanna help on Open Source? ðŸ¤²

Are you looking for projects to work on? I need some help on the following projects. PR is welcome:

- [Python Multipart](https://github.com/Kludex/python-multipart): We need to add `mypy` with the `strict` flag enabled.
- [FastAPI AsyncAPI](https://github.com/Kludex/fastapi-asyncapi): We need to actually make it work.
- [Uvicorn Worker](https://github.com/Kludex/uvicorn-worker): We need to migrate the workers from Uvicorn to this package, and setup the PyPI publish job.
